# SQL PROJECT CLASSIC MODELS MYSQL DATABASE 

The project revolves around solving critical business queries using a comprehensive MySQL sample database schema. This schema includes essential tables like Customers, Products, ProductLines, Orders, OrderDetails, Payments, Employees, and Offices. By harnessing the power of SQL, we aim to extract valuable insights, facilitate data-driven decision-making, and enhance overall business performance.

The MySQL sample database schema consists of the following tables:

- Customers: stores customerâ€™s data.
- Products: stores a list of scale model cars.
- ProductLines: stores a list of product line categories.
- Orders: stores sales orders placed by customers.
- OrderDetails: stores sales order line items for each sales order.
- Payments: stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.
- Employees: stores all employee information as well as the organization structure such as who reports to whom.
- Offices: stores sales office data.
